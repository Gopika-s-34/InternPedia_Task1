# Titanic Survival Prediction

As part of my Data Science internship at InternPedia, I've been working on an intriguing project that dives deep into the infamous Titanic disaster to predict passenger survival outcomes using data science techniques.

**Project Highlights:**

Objective: Analyze historical Titanic data to build a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of passenger survival.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Key Techniques: Data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.

**What I Learned:**

The importance of data preprocessing and how missing values can significantly impact model accuracy.

How to engineer features such as passenger class, gender, and age to improve prediction accuracy.

The process of comparing different machine learning models to identify the most effective one for this particular dataset.

**Outcome:**

By analyzing patterns and applying machine learning models, I achieved a model with an accuracy of 0.96%. This project not only enhanced my data science skills but also deepened my understanding of how data can be used to unravel historical events.

**Grateful for the Opportunity:**

A huge thank you to the InternPedia team for providing me with the platform to explore and grow in the field of data science. Iâ€™m excited to continue developing my skills and contributing to impactful projects!
